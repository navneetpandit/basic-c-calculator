🔢 Advanced Calculator in C (Modular & Menu-Driven)
📌 Overview

This project is an advanced, menu-driven calculator built in C as part of my learning journey in programming fundamentals and problem-solving.
What started as a basic calculator gradually evolved into a modular, feature-rich application by continuously upgrading logic, structure, and validation.

This project helped me understand loops, functions, modular programming, mathematical logic, and user-driven program flow.

✨ Features

Basic arithmetic operations

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with division-by-zero handling)

Advanced mathematical operations

Power calculation

Square root

Factorial

Prime number checking

Permutation (nPr)

Combination (nCr)

Geometry calculations

Area of Circle

Area of Triangle

Area of Rectangle

Area of Square

Menu-driven interface using do-while loop

Modular programming using functions

Input validation for invalid and edge cases

🧠 Concepts Learned

Modular programming using user-defined functions

Loops (for, do-while)

Conditional statements (if-else, switch)

Mathematical functions (math.h)

Input validation and error handling

Writing scalable and readable C programs

🛠 Technologies Used

Language: C

Libraries:

stdio.h

math.h

stdlib.h

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

Compile the program using:

gcc calculator.c -o calculator -lm


Run the executable:

./calculator


Note: system("cls") is used for screen clearing and works on Windows systems.

📈 Project Evolution

This calculator was not built in one go.
It was upgraded step-by-step by:

Refactoring repetitive code into functions

Adding new mathematical features

Improving user experience and validation

Learning from errors and edge cases

This repository reflects consistent learning, not perfection.

🎯 Future Improvements

Better handling of large numbers (overflow prevention)

Cleaner UI with numbered menu options

Operation history feature

Platform-independent screen handling

Code optimization and documentation

🙌 Acknowledgment

This project represents my first major step toward structured programming and strengthened my foundation in C.
More improvements and projects will follow as I continue learning.
