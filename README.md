🧮 Advanced Interactive Calculator (C Language)
📘 Overview

This project is an interactive, multi-functional calculator written in C.
It goes beyond basic arithmetic by supporting scientific, logical, and geometric operations — all within a user-friendly menu-driven system.
The calculator allows continuous use until the user chooses to exit, making it a true console-based application.

⚙️ Features

✅ Basic Arithmetic — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
✅ Power & Square Root operations (pow, sqrt)
✅ Factorial Calculation with negative input validation
✅ Area Calculations — Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, Square
✅ Prime Number Checker
✅ Continuous Operation using do-while Loop
✅ Input Validation for Division by Zero
✅ Clean Console using system("cls")
✅ Modular and beginner-friendly code structure

🧠 Concepts Used

Loops (for, do...while)

Conditional statements (if-else, switch)

Mathematical functions (pow, sqrt)

Logical flow control

Input/output handling

Dynamic program repetition

🧩 How It Works

The user selects an operation.

Inputs required numbers.

The calculator performs the operation and displays the result.

The user decides whether to continue or exit.

The screen clears for a new calculation (on supported compilers).

🧰 Technologies Used

Language: C

Headers: stdio.h, math.h, stdlib.h

Compiler: GCC / Code::Blocks / Dev C++

🚀 How to Run

Copy the code into your IDE (Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, or GCC).

Compile and run the program.

Follow on-screen instructions to perform various operations.

Type ‘Y’ to continue or ‘N’ to exit.

🌟 Example Output
Enter operation (+, -, *, /, ^, s, f, r, l): f
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120

Do you want to do more calculations (Y/N): y
