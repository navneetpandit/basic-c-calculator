🧮 Advanced Multi-Functional Calculator in C
📌 About the Project

This project is a Multi-Functional Calculator built using the C programming language.
It goes beyond basic arithmetic and includes advanced mathematical operations like power, square root, factorial, area calculation, and prime number checking.

Through this project, I’ve strengthened my understanding of:

Switch-case statements

Loops and conditionals

Functions from math.h

Logical structuring and debugging

⚙️ Features

✅ Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
✅ Power (^) operation using pow()
✅ Square root (sqrt()) for any chosen number
✅ Factorial calculation
✅ Area calculator for Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, and Square
✅ Prime number checker
✅ Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Improved logic building and problem-solving

Hands-on experience using control statements

Deeper understanding of how real-world calculators work internally

🚀 Future Enhancements

Integrate file handling for storing results

Create a GUI version using C++/Python
