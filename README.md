# Simple Calculator in C

This is my **first project in C programming** as a B.Tech Computer Science student.  
I wanted to apply what I learned in class (operators, conditionals, input/output), so I built a basic calculator.  

## What It Does
ðŸ‘‰ Takes two numbers from the user  
ðŸ‘‰ Lets the user choose an operator (+, -, *, /)  
ðŸ‘‰ Performs the calculation and prints the result  
ðŸ‘‰ Handles division by zero  
ðŸ‘‰ Program exits after one calculation (for now ðŸ˜…)  

## My Next Steps ðŸš€
- Add a **loop** so that multiple calculations can be done in one run  
- Convert into a **menu-driven calculator**  
- Add **mathematical functions** (square, cube, square root)  

## Example Run


## Why I Built This
To start my **coding journey** with a hands-on project, and to practice solving problems step by step.  
This is the foundation for more advanced projects Iâ€™ll build in the future ðŸš€
